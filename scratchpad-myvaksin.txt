1.  How to send TAC code?
2.  Apply TAC code to my applications




================
Pending Thoughts
================
1.  auto detect dob from given ic if it's an ic.
2.  auto capitalise the first letter of the name appearing at 
    pic section of people profile
[*]3.  add different SignUp status to the http api call so that 
    fe can display different message accordingly.
4.  Add VerifyToken function to every webservice api call.
[*]5.  Adjust the look of AppBar
[*]6.  Add Nginx reverse proxy
[*]7.  Either to make 'password' field nullable at DB level and create 
    a not-null check at frontend level, or 
    Make 'password' field not-null at DB level and create a default 
    password for every new profile created by myvaksin provider.
8. Add a url rewrite in Nginx config so that we can restrict 
   'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header.
9. Add a one way hashing function to hash the user password and 
   store it on the database instead of the original password.
10. Reduce the z-index of the profile pic on PeopleDetail page 
    because it's overlapping the AppBar when AppBar reappear 
    during scrolling up from bottom of the page.
11. Limit PeopleSearch page to role Administrator, Recruiter & Provider only.
    Receiver role should see only PeopleDetail page.         
12. Add a shortcut feature for myvaksin provider at PeopleSearch page to
    access COVID-19 vaccination records data-table by clicking at the 
    'COVID-19 Immun. Status' icon.
    KIV to complement this feature with QR code, where receiver present
    the QR code for provider to scan and then the receiver profile and 
    vaccination record page will appear automatically. Purpose is to 
    ease and speed up provider workflow.
13. To have a separate aefiClass & aefiReaction fields for 1st, 2nd & subsequent
    doses.
14. To have a separate select of vaccine type for each doses.
15. Add new vaccination application notification.
16. Add a refresh feature to PeopleSearch page after each add/edit/delete changes of
    vaccination record on the same page. (may be try emitting event of change 
    from the edit dialog child component to the parent PoepleSearch page)
17. Should i make the ic/passport field in PeopleDetail page immutable?
    A change or mistake in ic/passport will make the user unable to view their
    own profile or accidentally view other people profile if they register 
    an account with the wrong ic/passport.
    (SOLUTION: May be i should link the ic/passport field on the PeopleDetail page
    to the user accound ic/passport and make this field immutable?)
18. Add constraint to the VacRec Add/Edit dialog.

Notes

1. PostgreSQL 
   - It is ok to get from PostgreSQL timestamp value using pgx and
   Golang time.Time type, but it will fail when pgx is used to set PostgreSQL 
   timestamp value using Golang time.Time type.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
